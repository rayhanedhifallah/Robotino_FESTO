# Robotino_FESTO
This report contains a detailed description of the robot's object recognition process during its
navigation.
The first step is to communicate MATLAB with the ROBOTINOSIM and find the right
program implementation parameters.
The second step is to develop a PI regulator for navigation and find the right parameters for
the operation of this regulator.
The third includes the integration of a Deep Learning model into the program so that the robot
recognizes the objects that meet it.
